### CPSC 120

Lab 2 part 3 was my favorite lab by far out of my top three. The reason for this being it was my introduction to programming and entering into a new field that I have never seen before. Just understanding how everything works.

Lab 7 part 2 was my second favorite out of the three. My reasoning for this was I am able to create a card game I like playing and putting it into a program. It was an amazing experience to create and play it.

Lab 12 part 1 was my third favorite. It was not a bad one, just not one on the top of my list. However it is still fun to create an image and understand how they work.
